# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to improve the medical device connection workflow in the NOAH application by implementing a proper device connection sequence based on the official API workflow documentation. The current implementation has basic device connection functionality, but needs to be enhanced to follow the proper workflow steps, provide better user feedback, and ensure reliable device connections with proper error handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a medical professional, I want to see a clear device connection workflow that follows the proper initialization sequence, so that I can reliably connect to medical devices and obtain accurate measurements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the Device Connection screen THEN the system SHALL display the current SignalR connection status prominently
2. WHEN the user attempts to connect to the Patient Monitor THEN the system SHALL first verify that an emergency case is active
3. IF no emergency case is active THEN the system SHALL display an error message and prevent device connection
4. WHEN the Patient Monitor initialization is successful THEN the system SHALL update the device status to "connected" and enable real-time data reception
5. WHEN real-time data is received from the Patient Monitor THEN the system SHALL discriminate between JSON data and error messages as specified in the workflow

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a medical professional, I want to have proper error handling and user feedback during device connections, so that I can understand what went wrong and take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a device connection fails THEN the system SHALL display a specific error message explaining the failure reason
2. WHEN the backend is not running with elevated rights THEN the system SHALL display a warning about administrator privileges
3. WHEN a device is not pingable or available THEN the system SHALL show a connectivity error with troubleshooting suggestions
4. WHEN SignalR connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic reconnection and notify the user of the connection status
5. WHEN error messages are received via SignalR events THEN the system SHALL display them as error notifications instead of treating them as data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a medical professional, I want to see the proper workflow sequence for each device type, so that I can follow the correct steps to obtain measurements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to Blood Pressure device THEN the system SHALL only show "Read Data" option (no initialization required)
2. WHEN connecting to Temperature device THEN the system SHALL only show "Read Data" option (no initialization required)
3. WHEN connecting to Blood Glucose device THEN the system SHALL only show "Read Data" option (no initialization required)
4. WHEN the Patient Monitor is connected THEN the system SHALL provide an option to view the Patient Monitor screen
5. WHEN any device reading is in progress THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators and disable other actions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a medical professional, I want to have a centralized view of all device statuses and real-time data, so that I can monitor all connected devices from one screen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN devices are connected THEN the system SHALL display their current status with appropriate visual indicators
2. WHEN real-time data is available THEN the system SHALL display it in a formatted, easy-to-read manner
3. WHEN multiple devices are active THEN the system SHALL show data from all devices in an organized layout
4. WHEN data is updated THEN the system SHALL show the timestamp of the last update
5. WHEN no data is available THEN the system SHALL display "N/A" or appropriate placeholder text

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a medical professional, I want to navigate seamlessly between device connection and monitoring screens, so that I can efficiently manage the measurement workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Patient Monitor is successfully connected THEN the system SHALL provide a clear path to the Patient Monitor screen
2. WHEN viewing the Patient Monitor screen THEN the system SHALL continue to receive real-time data from the connected device
3. WHEN returning from the Patient Monitor screen THEN the system SHALL maintain the device connection status
4. WHEN navigating between screens THEN the system SHALL preserve SignalR connections and device states
5. WHEN the user wants to disconnect devices THEN the system SHALL provide clear disconnect options with confirmation
